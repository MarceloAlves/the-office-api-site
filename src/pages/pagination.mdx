# Pagination

Current the Episodes and Characters endpoints support pagination. By default each will return 10 records. {{ className: 'lead' }}

In paginated responses, objects are nested in a `results` attribute and have a `meta` attribute that includes the `nextPage`, `previousPage`, `pageCount` and some other useful attributes. You can use the `page` query parameter to browse pages.

## Example using offset

<Row>
  <Col>
    <Properties>
      <Property name="page" type="integer">
        The page you're wanting to view.
      </Property>
      <Property name="limit" type="integer">
        Limit the number of items returned.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

  </Col>
